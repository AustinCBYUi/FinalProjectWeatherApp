                <h2>Information</h2>
                <p>Some data may be inaccurate to specific search types.
                    For example, while searching coordinates, the times
                    may be inaccurate or just completely broken. This is
                    simply due to the API not supporting that data in the
                    response.
                </p>
                <p>OpenWeather API is quite a reliable source, but as always
                    please take all information from this application with a
                    firm understanding that things do change, and environmental factors
                    are unpredictable.
                </p>
                <p>Thank you for using the Weather Application!</p>
